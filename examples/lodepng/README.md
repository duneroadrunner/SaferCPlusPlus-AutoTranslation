This subdirectory contains versions of [LodePNG](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng), an open source png encoder/decoder, before and after (partial) conversion from C to [SaferCPlusPlus](https://github.com/duneroadrunner/SaferCPlusPlus). The conversion was done using the "safercpp-arr" tool that's part of the [mutator](https://github.com/bloodstalker/mutator) code analysis project. This conversion assistance tool is still in early development, and at the moment only converts native arrays and pointers used as array iterators to their SaferCPlusPlus counterparts.

Note that this tool uses the "clang libTooling" library and has only been tested on linux (as far as I know).

So here we'll explain the steps used to do the conversion. The first step is to verify that we can build and run the project to be converted. (On our development environment, compiling LodePNG required the following compiler options: -I'/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/include' -I'/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/include-fixed'.)

Next, we make a copy of the project in a new directory. Although the LodePNG project contains a number of source files, only four are used for the core functionality - lodepng.h, lodepng.cpp, lodepng_util.h and lodepng_util.cpp, so we (chose to) only address those files. 

The format of the conversion command is 

    {mutator_executable_directory}/safercpp-arr {source files to be converted} -- {compiler options}

So, from the source directory of the new copy of the project, we instigate the conversion with a command (in our case) like 

    {mutator_executable_directory}/safercpp-arr lodepng.cpp lodepng_util.cpp -- -I'/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/include' -I'/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5.4.0/include-fixed'

After some processing, the program will prompt for confirmation before replacing the source files with their converted versions. (The prompt can be suppressed with the "-SuppressPrompts" option.)

After running the conversion tool, some hand-processing may still need to be done. For example, if we try to compile the converted project we may get a compile error at line 711 of the lodepng.h file where we may find the following code:

    <<<<<<< /home/user1/dev/clang_tooling/mutator/targets_for_mutation/lodepng/lodepng-master/src/lodepng.h.converted
    MSE_LH_ARRAY_ITERATOR_TYPE(unsigned char)  lodepng_chunk_next(MSE_LH_ARRAY_ITERATOR_TYPE(unsigned char)  chunk);
    const MSE_LH_ARRAY_ITERATOR_TYPE(const unsigned char)  lodepng_chunk_next_const(MSE_LH_ARRAY_ITERATOR_TYPE(const unsigned char)  chunk);
    =======
    unsigned char* lodepng_chunk_next(unsigned char* chunk);
    const MSE_LH_ARRAY_ITERATOR_TYPE(const unsigned char)  lodepng_chunk_next_const(MSE_LH_ARRAY_ITERATOR_TYPE(const unsigned char)  chunk);
    >>>>>>> /home/user1/dev/clang_tooling/mutator/targets_for_mutation/lodepng/lodepng-master/src/lodepng.h.converted_2

You may recognize the format of this code snippet as the result of a [conflict encountered during a merge](https://linux.die.net/man/1/merge). Indeed that is this case here. So here we're going to need to resolve the conflict as we would with any other merge conflict. In this case, just keep the code from the first part and delete the second part. 

After fixing the merge conflict, we're done. Almost. We just need to download the [SaferCPlusPlus](https://github.com/duneroadrunner/SaferCPlusPlus) library and make sure it's in the include path. That should be it. This converted version of the project should compile and run. And, in theory, be safer as all the arrays and array pointers have been replaced with memory-safe substitutes.

Â¶


If you are wondering why there would be merge conflicts in the converted code, it's because the "clang libTooling" C/C++ code processing library we use only supports processing one source file and its dependent includes (aka "translation unit") at a time. But some (header) files are included by multiple source files, and so get converted multiple times. Since each conversion is done based only on the information available in the associated translation unit, conversions from different translation units may differ. So the conversion tool takes the changes from each conversion and merges them. By default, it uses the system's default "merge" command. But some merge tools may be better than others, and you can specify which merge command to use with the "-MergeCommand" option. For example, upon closer inspection, the merge conflict in our LodePNG example doesn't seem to be a real conflict at all, but simply an artifact of the default merge tool.

Ideally, rather than be restricted to the current translation unit, conversions would be based on information from all the specified translation units. To that end, there is an option, "-CTUAnalysis", that will, for each translation unit, cause the conversion tool to attempt to "import" program information from all the other translation units. In theory, this can reduce or eliminate discrepancies (and therefore merge conflicts) between conversions from different translation units. In practice, the libTooling library's support for this feature seems to be still immature and kind of buggy, sometimes leading to some unexpected results. But it may work well in your case, and it should get better as the libTooling library improves, so feel free to try it out. Also, at the time of writing (Aug 2017), attempting to import namespaces, or elements declared in a namespace, will cause the libTooling library to crash. So by default, the conversion tool avoids that. But this issue may be fixed in a future version of the libTooling library, so there is an option, "-EnableNamespaceImport", that will reenable this feature.
